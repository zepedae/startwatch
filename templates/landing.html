        Users can create a "watch" to record time spent working on a project. Working-time can then be visualized
        so users can evaluate their productivity across time.<br>
        Startwatch was born out of the feeling at the end of every day that I'd never done enough.<br>
        • Use in conjunction with a time goal and to do list every day<br>
        • On days you don't finish your to-do list you know you've made the effort<br>
        • On days you finish your to-do list before your time goal, spend a that extra time working on things you avoid adding to your to-do list for whatever reason</div>
