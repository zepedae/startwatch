                        Checking off to-do list items is important, but work that involves a lot of 
                        troubleshooting, creativity, or other forms of uncertainty, unforseen 
                        circumstances can make this difficult. Despite your considerable effort, these
                        unchecked lists can create a sense of failure that can reduce motivation 
                        or increasing overworking - causing you to miss out on the power of 
                        "stepping away" for creative problem solving.<br><br>

                        Startwatch solves this problem by using effort-based goals to help you
                        manage your productivity across different projects. After setting a
                        time-based productivity goal for a project (e.g., 2 hours/day), users can 
                        create a "watch" to record productivity for different projects each day. 
                        Productivity time can then be visualized so users can evaluate their productivity 
                        across time.<br><br>

                        Achieving productivity goals using this effort-based strategy leaves you with 
                        a feeling of accomplishment even on the days when your to-do list doesn't change
                        much. On days when your tasks are completed before your time goal 
                        is up, the strategy has the added bonus of encouraging you to work on those less
                        time-sensitive, easy to avoid tasks.
