# Startwatch

Startwatch is a time-management tool that uses time-based productivity goals to help users track and monitor their effort across different user-specified projects. With Startwatch you can create a working-time goal for a project, record your productivity using the app's stopwatch, and then reflect on your goals and effort by visualizing your productivity across time. 

## Functionalities
### Register - register a new account to create "watches" and track and visualize productivity

### Create new watch - users can create a new watch for tracking a project by entering a name and a working time goal for that target

### Watches - watches are displayed in tiles along with the options to track, edit, or visualize their data

#### Startwatch - track working time on the focal project
Visualize - graph daily working time
Edit - change the name of the project, change the working-time goal, or delete the project
