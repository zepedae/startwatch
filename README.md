# Startwatch

Startwatch is a time-management tool that uses time-based productivity goals to help users track and monitor their effort across different user-specified projects. With Startwatch you can create a working-time goal for a project, record your productivity using the app's stopwatch, and then reflect on your goals and effort by visualizing your productivity across time.
